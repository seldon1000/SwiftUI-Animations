# SwiftUI_Animations
This repository was created as Frontend project @ Apple Developer Academy | Naples. The goal of the repository is to showcase the potential of SwiftUI framework when implementing modern and complex animations. The project will be deeply analyzed, offering a complete explanation of what was done to implement Animation&Motion inside the application prototype.

The projects provided in this repository were derived from a mobile iOS game I developed, in collaboration with Leonardo Bertinelli, Clelia Iovine and Maddalena Zampitelli. The game is called Dotillism and is completely open source and made entirely using the SwiftUI framework. The game let use complete puzzles, where you to fill the available space inside a grid with colored dots. Since the actual game is pretty complex, I decided to scrap anything not needed for explaining my Animation&Motion work. If you like what you see here and want to dig deeper, or maybe have fun playing Dotillism, you find the link down below.

**Dotillism's GitHub**: https://github.com/uevs/Dotillism

**Dotillism's TestFlight**: https://testflight.apple.com/join/zSYqsIZx

Some key aspects of the project:
- SwiftUI
- @State
- Explicit animations
- Scale, opacity, color, etc transitions
- Concurrency


## Introduction
Animation&Motion, probably one of the most important aspects of UX design. In order to provide a good UX, an application should include nice, smooth and consistent animations. Animations let the user understand what's going on inside the app: a loading process, a swipe, a tap on the screen, everything should come with a coherent visual feedback.

Down below, you will find four different animations and their SwiftUI implementation. The project is split in four different repositories for clarity and cleanness. However, the current repository holds one project too, which is the combination of the four you see down here.
